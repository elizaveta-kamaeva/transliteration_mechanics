The maximum length for this fish is about 30 cm (12 in) but a more common length is 20 cm (8 in). The dorsal fin has no spines and 12 to 15 soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and 12 to 14 soft rays. The exceptionally large pectoral fins enable this fish to glide for long distances above the surface of the water. The upper parts of the body are an iridescent dark blue colour while the belly is silvery white. The pectoral fins and tail fin are greyish while the other fins are colourless. Juvenile fish are sometimes barred with black.[3] This species can be distinguished from the oceanic two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus obtusirostris) by having a less blunt snout and by the origin of the anal fin being at a location behind the origin of the dorsal fin.[4]
